Pairwise Asymmetric Interference

See LICENSE.txt for license information.

This code performs the convergent-cross mapping (CCM) and pairwise asymmetric interference (PAI) calculations in the following paper:

    "Convergent Cross-Mapping and Pairwise Asymmetric Inference"

    doi: [TBD]
    arxiv: [TBD]

The code calculates CCM correlations slightly differently than Sugihara et al., who originally introduced the techniques in "Detecting Causality in Complex Ecosystems" [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/338/6106/496.figures-only].  See the above paper for details on the algorithms used in the code.  The plots from the paper were generated with the initial commit version of this code.
